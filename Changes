0.01_01 - 20 June 2005
  - Typo in Build.PL/Makefile.PL (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

  **** Backwards Incompatible Change ****
  - Make namespace handling the same as XML::RSS - e.g.,
    <content:encoded> is not parsed as $item->{content}->{encoded}.
    (thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for suggestions)
  - Remove add_parse_context(), as it is no longer necessary.
  - Parsing is now done only on nodes that are immediately under
    <channel> and <item>. This is not correct spec-wise, but it does the
    job for most of the RSS out there.

0.01 - 14 June 2005
  - Seems like some people just think about the same thing. Tatsuhiko
    Miyagawa caught me doing some of the same thing he was doing in an
    unrelease module, so merged some features from his :)
  - Added add_module() (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
  - Added as_string() (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
  - Added add_parse_context().
  - Added fields to be parsed by default.
  - Changed internal representation a bit.
