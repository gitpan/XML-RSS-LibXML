0.01_01 - 20 Jun 2005
  - Typo in Build.PL/Makefile.PL (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

  **** Backwards Incompatible Change ****
  - Make namespace handling the same as XML::RSS - e.g.,
    <content:encoded> is now parsed as $item->{content}->{encoded}.
    (thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for suggestions)
  - Remove add_parse_context(), as it is no longer necessary.
  - Parsing is now done only on nodes that are immediately under
    <channel> and <item>. This is not correct spec-wise, but it does the
    job for most of the RSS out there.

0.01 - 14 Jun 2005

    Miyagawa caught me doing some of the same thing he was doing in an
    unrelease module, so merged some features from his :)
  - Added add_module() (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
  - Added as_string() (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
