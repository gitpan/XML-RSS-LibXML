Changes
=======

Except where noted, all changes made by Daisuke Maki

0.08 - 17 Aug 2005 ("Insanity" Release)
  - In a fit of insanity, I've implemented RSS generation code.
    Currently RSS version 0.9, 1.0, and 2.0 are supported.
  - You can now parse RSS, serialize it via as_string(), parse it again, and
    get (almost) the same structure back.
  - Separated out RSS parsing/generation code from main module. These modules
    are loaded as necessary, or by demand.
  - Updated benchmark.

0.07 - 15 Aug 205
  - Document MagicElements in the main docs.
  - Create XPathContext at parse time, andd call registerNs() only then.
  - Update benchmark for fairness. 
  - Changed code to use eh, cleaner Test::More code
  - Removed unused code

0.06 - 10 Aug 2005 ("Magic Is In The Air" Release)
  - Introduce MagicElement.pm. This allows us to parse RSS elements
    that have attributes without sacrificing the interface (hopefully).
    Inspired by patch from Taro Minowa.

0.05 - 04 Jul 2005 ("I'm so dumb" Release)
  - Make $item->{$namespace_uri}->{$tag} work. Patch by Naoya Ito.
  - Add corresponding tests. Patch by Naoya Ito.

0.04 - 21 Jun 2005
  - No code change.
  - Clarify compatibility issues.
  - Fix typos

0.03 - 21 Jun 2005
  - channel() fix by Naoya Ito (compatibility with XML::RSS)

0.02 - 21 Jun 2005
  - Doc tweaks.
  - This be 0.02. Remember to read the backward incompatible changes
    below.

0.01_01 - 20 Jun 2005
  - Typo in Build.PL/Makefile.PL (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)

  **** Backwards Incompatible Change ****
  - Make namespace handling the same as XML::RSS - e.g.,
    <content:encoded> is now parsed as $item->{content}->{encoded}.
    (thanks to Tatsuhiko Miyagawa for suggestions)
  - Remove add_parse_context(), as it is no longer necessary.
  - Parsing is now done only on nodes that are immediately under
    <channel> and <item>. This is not correct spec-wise, but it does the
    job for most of the RSS out there.

0.01 - 14 Jun 2005
  - Seems like some people just think about the same thing. Tatsuhiko
    Miyagawa caught me doing some of the same thing he was doing in an
    unrelease module, so merged some features from his :)
  - Added add_module() (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
  - Added as_string() (Tatsuhiko Miyagawa)
  - Added add_parse_context().
  - Added fields to be parsed by default.
  - Changed internal representation a bit.

0.01_02 - 14 June 2005
  - Doc screw up

0.01_01 - 14 June 2005
  - Initial CPAN release
